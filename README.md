# Fix this page

## navigation
- The list inside the navigation section shows some unusual symbols. 
    - Remove them (No symbols whatsoever should be shown)
    - The links should:
        - be bold, and have a bg color of rgb(13, 185, 227) when hovered
        - be bold, and black when visited
        - be bold, have an orange bg and red text when active
    - The links should be flush with the text "Games I used to play" 

## intro
- The background image of the intro section is not showing. Fix it.
- The white bg in the Intro section should be faded. The text, on the other hand, should be fully visible.
- The paragraph text should be bold.

## oldFavs
- The font of the LIs should be bold and black

## mario
- Span tags should not be orange but rather darkgreen

## retroGallery
- The yellow boxes should be grey, have rounded borders, and display an image when hovered.
        - each box should display a different image (you can find them in the images folder).
- Boxes should be stacked on top of each other and have a bit of room in between.            
- The h3 tag inside our retroGallery should have a grey bg, font should be bold, and the paragraph should have an orange bg.

## footer
- The list should have no symbols and no bg color
- Links should be bold, have a darkblue bg, and white font regardless of their state (just for the sake of the exercise. It is not a good practice!)
- Create an about page
- Inside the footer, add a link that takes you to the bottom of the about.html page 
- In the about.html page add a link to a telephone number and 2 paragraphs containing a floated image
- Validate your code using html validator
